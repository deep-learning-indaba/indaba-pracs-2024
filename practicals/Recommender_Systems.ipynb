    "\n",
    "Recommender Systems are probably one of the most ubiquitous type of machine learning model that we encounter in our online life. They influence what we see in our social media feeds, the products we buy, the music we listen to, the food we eat, and the movies we watch. Sometimes they're so good that people feel that their phone is spying on their conversations! In this prac, we hope to convince you that this isn't the case (mostly) as well as taking you through some of the techniques popularly used in industry that recommends the content you see online by building our very own movie recommender system.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're going shopping for a new book. You enter the store and start walking around scanning the shelves of books. Something catches your interest, you pause, take the book down and inspect the cover, and perhaps also read the blurb. You continue to do this until you find something you like at which point you purchase the book and leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine you've read the book and quite enjoyed it and you want to buy another one. You go back to the store, browse around, and occasionally inspect some books that catch your interest. An assistant this time approaches you asking if you need help. Gladly you accept, and you mention the books you were looking at as well as the one that you purchased recently. Since they've been working there a long time and have helped many customers, they now have a good idea of what you may like and recommends a short list of books for you to look at. You do so and eventually settle on one to purchase.\n",

    "\n",
    "- From all the books in the store, what does it say about the ones you paused to look at, the ones you ignored, and the ones you purchased?\n",
    "- What does it say about you as the reader and your preferences? Could there be\n",
    "other people like you?\n",
    "- How was the assistant able to narrow down all the books in the store to just a few from which you actually purchased one?\n",

    "The answer to these questions is now getting into the heart of recommender systems. Your behaviour probably wasn't random but instead had some structure and logic to it. You also likely have particular preferences to some genres and/or authors. Without even knowing anything else about the books, this follows then that the books you looked at and purchased matched those preferences and the ones you ignored more likely did not. Additionally, based on your preferences, what was catching your interest, and what you previously read, the store assistant was able to stitch together a rough profile of you. She then thought about her previous customers similar to you and what they had previously purchased. This is how she was then able to shortlist relevant books for you to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you probably guessed it by now, the store assistant is the recommender system in this example. Instead of a person though, we want to build something that is able to learn the latent structure between all the books, all our customers, and how well they match each other in order to then make our recommendations. In the following sections we will learn how to do this. But first let's go over the general architecture of a recommender system."

    "\n",
    "The above diagram generalises our previous scenario from books to searches, songs, and movies (note there will usually only be one) while the user is you as before. Notice how the user interacts with these *items* which then gets sent to the recommender system as feedback. The recommender system processes this, retrieves relevant items from it's database and then serves them to the user. The user, in turn, further interacts with these items and continues this loop until some terminating criteria. Perhaps they found a movie they like and started watching, or they purchase a book like in our previous example, or they simply leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you may have noticed some new terminology in the diagram, the *query / context* on the user side of diagram. This is a further generalisation of what we're retrieving relevant items for. In this example it's the user but it can also include their previous searches, item interactions, the time of day, the device they're using, or any of combination of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.2.2 Zooming in**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's zoom in closer to the recommender system now by having a look at how YouTube described theirs back in 2016 in their seminal paper on the topic. Being YouTube, the items here would be videos which number in the millions (and most likely in the billions as of writing in 2023). Pay special attention to the blue stages, notice the number of items going into each stage going down and hence the funnel shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the first one, the job of the *candidate generation* stage is to efficiently *retrieve* relevant items from your database (which is why you may find in the literature, this stage is also known as *retrieval*). Speed is of the utmost importance here so some leeway is allowed in terms of relevancy as long as the number of items we reduce down to is manageable for the downstream parts of the recommender. This lookup speed is achieved partly by the techniques we discuss and implement later in this practical but also by limiting the number of features that feed into this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second *ranking* stage (also known as *scoring*) then takes these items and sorts them based on additional features that come from the user as well as the features of the item itself to optimise for some target we care about. In the case of YouTube, it will be for watch time, or in the case of an e-commerce website, the likelihood to purchase the items. Another reason for a ranking stage is that you may have multiple candidate generators and you now need a way to combine the results in some optimal way, at which point they're then shown to the user. It's also important to note, this ranking stage is not always necessary. Sometimes the retrieval step is good enough and you can keep the complexity of the system down, reduce implementation times, lower maintenance overhead, and therefore costs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, this last diagram, courtesy of the recommendations team at NVIDIA, further expands on the above ideas by defining two more stages namely *filtering* and *ordering*. After the retrieval / candidate generation stage, we may find that some of the items, while relevant, aren't useful and so need to be filtered out. In an e-commerce scenario this could be an item that's out of stock or in the case of a social media platform, a post coming from a person or topic you've blocked / muted. The *ordering* step which takes place after ranking / scoring then refers to further refining the order of the items depending on some business logic. For example, promoting on sale items or perhaps even sponsored placements.\n",

    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering is a technique that learns how to recommend items to user A based on the interests of a similar user B by using similarities between these users and items simultaneously. This is opposed to content-based filtering that uses hand-engineered and/or explicit features of an item for further recommendations for e.g. recommending a movie in the same genre of one who you already watched.\n",

    "Consider a movie recommendation system in which the training data consists of a feedback matrix $A ∈ R^{m × n}$ where $m$ is the number users and $n$ is the number of items. Each row then represents a user and each column represents an item (a movie) with the entries indicating a users rating of a particular movie. Our goal then is to learn\n",
    "- A user embedding matrix $U ∈ \\mathbb{R}^{m × d}$, where row $i$ is the embedding for user $i$ and $d$ is the length of the embedding.\n",

    "such that their product $UV^{T}$ is a good approximation of the feedback matrix $A$. Note that the $(i, j)$ entry of $UV^{T}$ is simply the dot product of $⟨ U_i, V_j ⟩$ of the embeddings of user $i$ and item $j$ which you want to be as close as possible to $A_{ij}$. This process of finding these matrices $U$ and $V$ is known as *matrix factorisation*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Take special note how the matrices $U$ and $V$ give a more compact representation of the full matrix, even in this toy example (in practice $d$ is much smaller than $m$ and $n$ since you will have many more users and items). As a result, this process finds latent structure in the data without even requiring any knowledge of the movies themselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are two common algorithms for finding these matrices, namely\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) which is a generic method to minimise loss functions\n",
    "- Weighted Alternating Least Squares (WALS) which is specialised to this particular problem and works by alternating between fixing $U$ and solving for $V$ and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practical, we'll be using SGD to learn these matrices which means we have to define a loss function. One intuitive function is the squared distance. To do this, we minimise the average of squared errors over all pairs of observed entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{1}{|obs|} ∑_{(i,j) \\in obs} (A_{ij} - ⟨ U_i, V_j ⟩)^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this loss function defined, we can then randomly initialise our matrices $U$ and $V$, and through SGD iteratively update them until $UV^T$ is a good approximation of $A$. We now finally have all the pieces to move ahead with the rest of the tutorial.\n",

The embeddings can be used for candidate generation as follows: given a query embedding $q \\in E$, the system looks for item embeddings $x \\in E$ that are close to q i.e. embedding with high similarity $s(q,x)$. To determine similarity, most recommendation systems rely on one or more of the following:\n",

We need a way to perform these calculations much more efficiently. This is where *Approximate Nearest Neighbours* comes in. The idea is we tradeoff a small degree of accuracy in our similarity search but in exchange gain an enormous amount of performance (orders of magnitude).\n",

The algorithm works by recursively splitting our embedding space by random hyperplanes, where each hyperplane is represented by a node in a tree, until there are at most $k$ items at every leaf node. In order to find the nearest neighbours for a specific embedding, the tree is traversed by calculating on which side of the hyperplane the point lies at every node and then returning the items at the final node. See the below image to get an idea of what the splitting looks like in a 2D space and the resulting tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "To build recommender systems, there are two types of feedback we train our models against.\n",

    "- **Implicit**: the feedback is inferred based on how the users are interacting with the items. For example clicking an item, watching a video video, adding a product to your basket and/or purchasing.\n",

Explicit feedback comes from the users naturally using the product (for e.g. reviewing the product) while the implicit data is usually coming from the telemetry infrastructure monitoring how users are interacting with your application. Depending on the maturity of this infrastructure, this can simply be logging what you're clicking on but can also include timing how long you've been on a page, the location your web requests are originating from, tracking exactly what content you've been exposed to, and even whether you simply hovered over an item and for how long. All of this data is logged and dumped into massive data stores to be later cleaned, analysed, and eventually trained on to create the recommender models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can actually answer the question posed in the title of this prac. These massive datasets comprised of both implicit and explicit feedback along with the large recommender models trained on them is how the recommendations can sometimes feels so good. So while your phone is not actually listening in on your conversation where you might have expressed some interest in those items, you more than likely also showed that interest implicitly by the simple usage of these internet platforms and this is all that was needed to figure out your preferences (especially when keeping in mind the thousands or even millions of people who might have interacted with the platform in similar ways). Now keep in mind how large these datasets and models can become. In this prac we built relatively small models on just 1MB of data and were still able to make plausible recommendations. They only get better when you scale them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully now that your mind is at ease that you're not being spied on, we hope that you're now not nervous about how much of your usage data is being logged. At least no you can make a more informed decision about whether or not the quality of the recommendations you get is worth this tradeoff. Keep in mind, the purpose of these systems is to help you find the content you're looking for and discover content you might not have otherwise found. If this is still not worth it for you, luckily regulations are catching up and that it may start to become mandatory for to allow users to opt out of personalised recommendations."

    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this prac we introduced the general architecture of recommender systems and specifically focused on retrieving relevant items for users. We did this by demonstrating how Colaborative Filtering could be used for this task. Lastly we also described the type of data that's collected and how it's all crunched to construct the datasets used to build the recommender models.\n",
