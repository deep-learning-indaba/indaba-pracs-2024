        "  - **Genome size**: Animal genomes are typically much larger (humans have 3.2 billion DNA bases) while bacterial genomes are smaller (few hundred thousand to a few million).\n",
        "  - **Chromosomes**: Animals have multiple linear chromosomes, while bacteria typically have a single circular chromosome.\n",
        "  - **Gene density**: Bacterial genomes are more gene-dense, while animal genomes are more sparse and have more regulatory elements.\n",
