For both these connections, the result is normalized using layernorm. In certain implementations, these normalization steps are applied to the inputs rather than the outputs. Just like a Resnet, transformers are designed to be very deep models thus, these add and norm blocks are essential for a smooth gradient flow.  \n",

This block receives the output of the final encoder block, the transformed tokens, and uses that as the key-value pairs, while using the output of the first MHA block as the query.
